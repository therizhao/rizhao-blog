I don't worry about tomorrow,
<br />for heaven is perfect,
<br />and every moment is bliss.

If this life is heaven,
<br />I don't worry about dying,
<br />for heaven is eternal,
<br />and death is a construct.

If this life is heaven,
<br />I don't make enemies,
<br />for everyone is an angel,
<br />with a heart of gold.

If this life is heaven,
<br />I breathe in;
<br />I thank the plants,
<br />the animals,
<br />the oceans,
<br />the oil-rigs, 
<br />the lampposts,
<br />the rubbish bins,
<br />the tempeh,
<br />the meat on the shelf.

If this life is heaven,
<br />I will protect the Earth,
<br />and all that grows,
<br />for everything,
<br />is what makes this life heaven.
