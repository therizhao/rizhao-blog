7th January 2017. I sat in a lounge chair in the library with my bald head. I was waiting eagerly for my NS journey to start. I had heard stories about it, mainly positive ones.

Despite my excitement for this new chapter in life, I did not want to be a soldier. I hate violence. I believe that _war is never right_, no matter which side we are on.

My goal was to either be a clerk or an officer. It was either _I gave the least or I earned the most pay_.

The BMT phase of the journey was _awful_.
We hardly had any time for ourselves. Every night was a battle for the showers. We were often given only 5 minutes every night to shower, brush our teeths and call our parents.

There were days I look _enviously at the cats in our camp_. They can at least take their time to eat and relax whenever they want.

**Each day felt like a year.** I was disillusioned with the system. I realised how dirty power can be and how little control we have upon ourselves.

Some way or another, _we made it through_.

I didn't feel any joy when I threw my jockey cap in the air during the Passing Out Parade. I was merely _relieved_ that it was over.

I _travelled alone_ for the first time in the block leave that followed. I went to Vietnam, met the most amazing people, gained a fresh perspective of life and most importantly **hope.**

The _kindness of strangers_ touched my heart. I had a new-found faith in humanity and optimism for my life ahead.

The happiness was **short-lived** however.
Soon, I found myself in a new camp, training to become a Scout Trooper.

Training was tough but conditions were slightly better. Our shower time increased from 5 minutes (in BMT) to half an hour each night.

Despite being treated with _more dignity_ as a human being, the gloomy clouds still cast over our heads. Our company was ruled by an _erratic dictator_, who lashed out threats to take away over weekends as he wished.

_Traveling was my only source of comfort_. I went to the nearby Batam whenever there was a long weekend. _The kind and genuine hearts_ of my hosts gave me the energy to keep going.

_One fateful night in camp_, I thought of **an idea to escape**. It was actually pretty simple. _Buy a plane ticket and never come back_.

The idea lingered in my head day after day. Eventually, I _gave in_. I flew to _Vietnam_, the place where I first found my self.

The _tears_ of my family pulled me back.

I never felt such _great fear_ before. I would be _shamed and lynched_.

To my surprise, **they forgave me**.

I will never forget the _power of empathy_. I will always be _thankful_ for the chance they had given me.

I still _hated the army_. I still hated every moment in camp. But I learnt to _tolerate_. Since I did not have the ability to leave, _I would survive the best way possible_.

The following months were spent _proving my worth_. I pushed myself to the _limits_.

I did not want to be a Scout. I did not want to be a soldier.

But I will _fight for myself_.

I missed out on the Scout course for my unit due to my unexpected escape.

I joined the course with another unit.

It was a refreshing atmosphere. I made new friends with common ambitions.

The highlight of the course was the _prisoner-of-war_ training. The commanders became the _"enemy"_.

I thoroughly _enjoyed the process_. It was the first time I got the chance to _openly rebel_ without my weekends being threatened. The physical torture was nothing compared to the _mental torment_ I had been put through.

On the afternoon before our 20km route march, **Astar Tutors was born**.

It started out as a _simple idea_. Each member can _post a job_ and/or _apply for a job_. The tutor who applied for the job will _pay a commission_ to the one who posted it.

There was no hierarchy, no one more powerful than the other. We were simply a 5 person _Whatsapp_ group eager to find tuition jobs.

It was also during this period I started to learn programming. I was determined not to let NS waste my life away.

The days zoomed past. The course was finally over and I was presented with the _"coveted" recon tab_.

I returned to my previous unit with great excitement. I couldn't wait to see those familiar faces again.

The _monotonous_ life back in camp quickly became _dreary_ however.

I was _lost like a driftwood_. Having established my status by going through the Scout course, I had _nothing left to fight for_.

In the meantime, the **Astar Tutors group grew**. We reached _100 members_ by the following year.

I did not think much of the idea at first. But the growing size of the group _proved otherwise_. I assembled a team to manage the group and post tuition jobs.

The 256 members limit Whatsapp placed on groups was starting to concern us. We quickly moved into a _Telegram channel_ to accommodate our growing size.

This was the first time _my programming skills came in handy_. The backend was nothing complicated. It was simply a web server that forwarded new jobs from a form to the Telegram channel.

The **Astar Tutors project kept me busy**. It isn't everyday that you get a chance to build _something people love_.

I spent my days in and out of camp working on Astar Tutors. From coming up with fairer commission rules to creating new features, I _enjoyed the process thoroughly_.

It was _my escape_ from the meaningless life in the army.

It was also a _quiet form of rebellion_ to me. I wasn't just another soldier. The army could take my arms and legs, but _my mind belonged to my own._

The days past quickly. Soon, I was just _a few months away_ from ORD.

At the same time, the Astar Tutors Telegram channel _grew_. I was beginning to receive feedback that there were _too many jobs posted_, with only a few of them relevant to what each tutor wants.

It was a _terrible user experience_. The tutor had to crawl through the huge list of jobs to find his/her desired job.

I thought of an idea to create a _custom filter_ for each tutor. The tutor would only receive notifications for jobs he/she wants. To create this feature, we would require a _full-scale web app._

This was when **I began my journey to build my first app.**

I dived deep into learning how to create a web app. I spent almost _every waking hour_ outside of army watching tutorials and reading guidebooks.

There were times when it seemed like I was _going nowhere_. My desire to see my app go live _kept me persevering._

There is something incredible about the process of creation. It's _all-consuming, exhausting, yet incredibly satisfying._

When I started to code, I was _completely in my own world_, oblivious of the time and my surrounding.

There was once when I went to camp in shorts, as I was _too absorbed_ thinking about a feature I was building. Thankfully, my friend _dashed out to my rescue_ with his long pants, otherwise I would have spent that weekend trapped in camp.

I spent my days in camp bugging _almost every person_ I can find, asking them to try out my prototype to look for areas of improvement.

I was determined to build the best user experience I could. Everyday was a step closer to the dream.

My quest was interrupted by our final military exercise in Australia. I spent 4 weeks away from my computer, in the sparse Australian desert.

It was a separate reality from the one I was living in. _I followed orders, walked through chilly nights_ and _slept in cramped Broncos_.

The darkness of the nights _brought back memories_. I remembered the many times I felt lost, love that was never meant to be, my escape and _the escape I still longed for..._

_I walked aimlessly._ The monstrous backpack and rifle sling ate into my skin. I didn't care about our mission. All I knew was, every step was _a step closer to freedom._

Fortunately, the passage of time _never stops_. No matter what situation we are in, it will _pass eventually._

When I returned to Singapore, I immediately got back to work. I was just _a few bug fixes away_ from launching the app.

The hard work eventually _paid off._

On 28 October midnight, the **Astar Tutors web app launched.**

I was mixed with both _fear_ and _excitement._

Finally, my first ever product had _gone live_. Yet, I was worried that there might be bugs that I missed out or that users would not like my product.

Thankfully, the _user feedback was good_. It was heartening to hear from tutors how the app made finding a job much more convenient for them.

These are the _moments that we live for_. To know that we have made an impact in someone's life, is the _greatest reward of any pursuits_.

My days in NS came to _an end_.

Despite looking forward to my release since the day I entered, _I didn't feel much._

There was _no celebration_ or _cries of joy_.

I was merely relieved that I could finally have _my freedom returned back to me_.

**The end is only the beginning.**
