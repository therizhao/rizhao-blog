He lives in a growth machine.

Aiming for good grades in school.<br />
Working hard to earn that extra buck.<br />
Thinking of ways to make people spend more.

The world revolves around cost and benefit.<br />
Those who strive for profits are rational.<br />
Those who don't are dumb.

The society has different castes.<br />
People are divided into their castes based on their wealth.<br />
The most superior lives in sky-high penthouses.<br />
The middle-income stays in high-rise apartments.<br />
At the bottom are labourers, working with their sweat and blood, living in cramped bunk beds.

He lies in the coffin, waiting to die.<br />
He counts the value of his numerous assets.<br />
Just over a billion dollars.

The undertaker pushes him into the cremator.<br />
He smiles satisfied.
