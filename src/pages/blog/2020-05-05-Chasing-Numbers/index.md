spoiler: A life of value.
---

I live in a growth machine.

Aiming for good grades in school.<br />
Working hard to earn that extra buck.<br />
Thinking of ways to make people spend more.

The world revolves around cost and benefit.<br />
Those who strive for profits are rational.<br />
Those who live outside of the economic paradigm are stupid.

Our society has different castes.<br />
People are divided into their castes based on their wealth.<br />
The most superior caste lives in sky-high penthouses.<br />
The second level is the middle-income, staying in high-rise apartments.<br />
Below them are their neighbours living in rental flats.<br />
At the bottom are labourers, working with their sweat and blood, living in cramped bunk beds.

I lie in the coffin, waiting to die.<br />
I count the value of my numerous assets.<br />
I am worth just over a billion dollars.

The undertaker pushes me into the crematorium.<br />
I smile satisfied.
