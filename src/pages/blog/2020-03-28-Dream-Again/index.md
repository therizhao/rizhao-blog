spoiler: The same pitch back sky...

The same pitch back sky,<br />
where I waited for life to begin,<br />
where I waited for time to end,<br />
where I dreamed of changing the world,<br />
where I cried my dreams away<br />

The same pitch back sky,<br />
staring at me with its twinkling stars,<br />
confronting me with its vast emptiness,<br />
questioning me with its dull gray clouds

The same pitch back sky,<br />
transporting myself,<br />
back in time,<br />
back to where it all started,<br />
back to where dreams belong<br />

Is it time,<br />
to dream again?
