It's a heavy word.

"Follow your passion and do what you love!"
<br />We hear this all the time.

For years, I thought,
<br />passion is a magical fairytale,
<br />where every challenge feels so satisfying,
<br />where every second makes you feel alive. 

For years, I've been searching,
<br />but I can't seem to find my it;
<br />there's no one work I truly love;
<br />there's no one job I want to spend my entire life doing.

I enjoy walking in the park,
<br />breathing in fresh air.

I enjoy changing water for my plants,
<br />giving thanks to them for beautifying my room.

I enjoy moving bytes,
<br />creating virtual worlds.

I enjoy designing,
<br />turning dreams into reality.

I enjoy writing,
<br />discovering my thoughts.

I enjoy every day,
<br />every challenge,
<br />every interaction,
<br />every moment.

I still can't find my passion.

And I don't plan on finding it.
