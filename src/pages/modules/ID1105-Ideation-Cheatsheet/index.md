## General Tips

- Start with a structure, improvise as you go
- Creative angle -> Creative solution

## Ideating in a group

- Role of a designer: Facilitate the process of idea genesis

### Steps

1. Warm up
   1. People usually are more reserved in ideating intially
   2. Here's when you observe `safe` solutions
2. Keep going
3. People starts feeling shag
   1. Here's when unconventional ideas come about
4. Leverage on these unconventional ideas to come up with practical solutions

### How to warm up faster?

- Icebreakers
- Explain the process first before starting

### Common Gotchas

- Being critical at the start diminishes chances of innovative ideas appearing
- Gravitating to past experiences as springboard limits ideas generated

## Generating Ideas

### Listing

**Steps:**

1. For each word in the problem, list out as many variation as you can

- e.g. How to reduce food waste?
  - different types of food
    - spicy
    - snack
    - raw...

2. Ideate from each list item

- e.g. How to reduce wastage of raw food?

**Rationale:**

- Expand your starting point

### Value Ladder

**Steps:**

1. Problem statement on a y-axis
2. What causes the problem?

- Go up the axis

3. What the problem causes?

- Go down the axis

**Rationale:**

- Reframing question

### Adding constraints

1. Narrow the scope of the question

- e.g. How to make a better bottle?
  - Change to: How to make a bottle that sells more?

**Rationale:**

- Constraints help you generate metrics of success

### Questioning the question

**Steps:**

1. Substitute words in the question
   - e.g. How to steal money?
     - Can change to: How to make more money?
2. Ideate from there

**Rationale:**

- Solve the root cause of the problem

### Word Vomit

**Steps:**

1. Vomit out as many words as possible before looking at the problem statement
2. Evaluate problem statement with words generated

**Rationale:**

- Look at problem from another perspective

## Evaluating Ideas

### Feasibility Chart

1. Place sticky notes on a chart

- x-axis: Value to user
- y-axis: Ease of implementation

**Rationale:**

- Evaluate cost and benefits of idea

**Variations:**

- Could change axes to any metric of your choice

### Telegram MVP

1. For social platform related ideas, can build a MVP using telegram API

- MVP should take < 1 day to build

**Rationale:**

- Quickly test the market without incurring too much costs
- Opportunity to refine on business logic of application based on real user feedback
