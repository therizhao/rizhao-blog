![Steaming Kueh](9.jpg)

16.  At 11 min, I kinda feel like giving up
17.  At 14 min, I took out the cup
    -  My mum tried it. She said it's not "too bad" ü§î

![Cup is out](10.jpg)

18. At 18 min. I removed the Kueh.

### Reflection time

- Things didn't turn out as bad as I expected it to be
- Location may affect the Kueh made
  - E.g. Prototyping Lab vs RC vs My Home vs My Friend's Home
- Unplanned-for ingredients might be the dealbreakers sometimes


## E02 18-08-19 

- Goal: Try something new
- Location: Pantry@RVRC
- Partner: Ambrose

1. We had a Kueh voting session
2. Each of us is given 5 strips of paper which we use to vote for our favourite Kuehs
3. Our favourite kuehs are divided into 2 segments
   - Kuehs we think are created by accidents üí•

## E04 01-09-19

- For this experiment, I want to explore the variations of negative imprints different objects have on a kueh.

### Steps

1. Add `1 : 1 : 1` ratio of rice flour, tapioca flour and water
2. Mix evenly until a gooey mixture is formed
3. Apply mixture over object X
4. Steam them in a leaf

## E05 07-09-19

- After the last lesson, I concluded that I want to focus on making an organic form
- While researching on my designer assigned for ID1223, I saw this very interesting lamp
  
![](https://media.fds.fi/product_image/800/13Flos_AK.jpg)

*What if... I can make a Kueh Lamp ü§Ø*


### I20 Medimum Rock Kueh Lamp

3. Mixed evenly until a gooey paste was formed
4. Applied paste evenly on the rock
5. Steamed for 5 min
6. Let it cool for 10 min
7. Transferred rock with Kueh into an oven and baked it at 180 degreees for 10 min
8. Transferred rock into a refrigerator and left it overnight
9. Cut kueh into half
10. Tried to stick kueh together with more kueh but failed

![](92.jpg)

### I21 XL Rock Kueh Lamp

1. Found a huge rock
2. Added `3 : 2 : 2` ratio of rice flour, potato starch and water
3. Mixed evenly until a gooey paste was formed
4. Applied paste evenly on the rock
![](118.jpg)

6. Steamed for 5 min
7. Let it cool for 10 min
8. Baked for 5 min
![](98.jpg)
9. It failed as it was impossible to remove the kueh from the rock
![](99.jpg)

### I22 Rice Tapioca Leaf Kueh Lamp

1. Found a huge leaf
2. Mixed `2:1:1` ratio of rice flour, tapioca starch and water
3. Spreaded mixture over leaf
4. Steamed for 10 min
5. Let cool for 10 min
6. Tried to remove the Kueh and fold it but it was to soft to stand on its own

### I23 Sago Powder Folded Leaf Kueh Lamp

1. Find a huge leaf
2. Mix `1:1:1` ratio of sago powder, potato starch and water
3. Spread mixture thinly over leaf
4. Steam for 10 min
5. Let cool for 5 min
6. Fold leaf to let kueh stand (Use rocks as support structure)
7. Let cool overnight

![](100.jpg)

*I finally achieved the 3D quality üéâ*

![](104.jpg)
![](105.jpg)

## E06 16-09-19

- After the last lesson, I learnt that we can use a light source as plating
- I realised however then I can continue working on the 3D quality of the kueh
- For this experiment, I restricted my ingredients to solely sago powder
  - as I realised that it's tough construction when dried makes it ideal for making large structures
- The only variation between each kueh is the way I poured the flour mixture onto the leaf

### I24-25 Sago leaf Kueh

1. Added 200g sago powder and 200ml water into a container and mix evenly
2. Poured mixture through a sieve into another container
3. **Poured mixture onto leaf**
4. Steamed mixture with leaf
5. Laid steamed Kueh with leaf on a coconut husk
6. Waited for 2 days
7. Removed kueh from leaf

#### I24 Sculputure-like Kueh

- Mixture was poured in a drip-like manner

![](122.jpg)

![](110.jpg)

#### I25 Web-like Kueh

- Mixture was spread out evenly around the leaf

![](125.jpg)

![](126.jpg)

![](109.jpg)

#### Choosing the final piece

- I24 was the first choice
- However, it shrivelled after I removed it from the mold too early
- I experimented with a few more Kuehs but most of them cracked when I am trying it to peel if off the leaf
- In the end, I decided to go with I25
