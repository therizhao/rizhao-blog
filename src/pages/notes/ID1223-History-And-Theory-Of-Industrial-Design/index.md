### Shaker

`Don't make something unless it is both necessary and useful; but if it is both necessary and useful, don't hesitate to make it beautiful`

- Founder: Mother Ann Leader
- Origin: Emigrated from England
- To: Colonial America

#### Philosophy

- Regularity is beautiful
- Order is the origin of beauty
- That which is most practical is also beautiful

#### Production principles

- Open to technical innocations
- Codification of the production
  - e.g. Color coding

### Arts & Craft Movement

- Reactionary movement against industrialisation

#### Key Figures

- William Morris (1834 - 1896)

#### Examples

![Nautilus toilet](https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NzY4WDc2OA==/z/oQwAAOSw0UdXsxSj/$_10.JPG)

#### Writings

- Nature of Gothic - Stones of Venice (John Ruskin)

`If humanity does not find the idea of happiness through work, then humanity must abandon all ideas of happiness`

```t
Kitsch: German word for trash
English: Cheap, vulgar & sentimental forms
```

#### William Morris' ideals: Craft guild

- Occupational associations comprised of all artisans and craftsmen in a particular branch of industry

- Functions
  - Establish monopoly of trade
  - Set & maintain standards

#### Reasons for end

- Artisan approach proved too elitist, too expnesive and failed its social invocation
- Legacies
  - Influenced the Deutscher Werkbund movement

### Art Nouveau

- Jugendstil in German, Stile Liberty in Italian, Modernisme in Catalan, etc. In English it is also known as the Modern Style (not to be confused with Modernism and Modern architecture) (from wikipedia)

- Influencing movement:
  - [Japonism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japonism)

`This ornamentation arises out of the object with which its connected. It refers to the purpose or its won method of construction. Ornamentation becomes organic to the object and refuses to be nothing more than something glued onto it.`

#### Basic Principles

- Social idealism carried over from the Arts & Craft movement
- Embraced technology and industrial process unlike Arts & Craft movement
- Decoration integral to function
- `Total work of artÅ“`

#### Early Styles

- Referencing nature
- Curvilinear
- Flowing lines
- Sinews
- Organic

#### Decline

- Too expensive & elitist
- Too complicated to produce
- Criticised for being too lavish

### Summary of Movements (A)

| Shakers       | Practical is beautiful                    |
| Arts & Crafts | Respect the craftsman, Respectal material |
| Art Nouveau   | Functional Ornamentation                  |

### Deustcher Werkbund

`Ornament is a waste of the energy of labour, and therfore a waste of helth. Today it also means squandered capital. The modern person, the person wiht modern nerves, does not need ornament, on the contrary, he detests it.`

`Only through standardisation, which must be understood to be th result of healthy conecntration, can we find the way back to a universally valid and sure taste.`
_Hermann Muthesisus_

**Turbine Factory**
