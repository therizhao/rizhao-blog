## Lecture 1

### Static Typing vs Dynamic Typing

- Java is a type-safe language, very strict in type-checking

### i/o

- java DiscCoverage < data.in > data.out (results are added to a new file)

### Composite Data: Array

### Disc Coverage Problem

- Find the number of points covering a unit disc centered at each point

### Mental Modeling

- Establish a mental model that is correct, consistent and complete

### Stack vs Heap memory

- Stack
  - special region in computer's memory that stores temp variables created by each function (last in, first out)
- Heap
  - region of computer memory not managed automatically for you
  - is not as tightly managed by the cpu
  - free floating region of memory

### Homework: Imperative solution disc coverage

### Abstraction barrier

- Separation between implementer and client
  - implementer dfines the data/functinoal abstractions
  - client uses the high level data type and methods
- Must facilitate communication across the barrier
- Abstraction
- Encapsulation
  - Package related data and behaviour
  - hide information/data from the client
  - Mutation should be done through methods only

## Lecture 2

### Testability in OOP

- How testable is the program for others?

- Abstraction barrier

  - Barrier between the implementer and the client

### Writing tests

```java
// Bad example
Point p = new Point(1,2)
p.setX(5);
p.getX() == 5.0;
p.setX(10);
p.getX() == 10.0;
```

- Makes less sense as getX returns 2 different values
- Better way to unit test is to return this in setX
  - So that you can method chain

```java
new Point(1,2).setX(5).getX() == 5.0;
```

- To write reliable tests
  - Once Object is instantiated, Object should be immutable
  - To do so return a new Object rather than this

```java
// Bad
Point p = new Point(1,2);
p.incX(0.5).getX() == 1.5;
p.incX(0.5).getX() == 2.0;
p.incX(0.5).getX() == 2.5;
```

```java
// Good
Point p = new Point(1,2);
p.incX(0.5).getX() == 1.5;
p.incX(0.5).getX() == 1.5;
p.incX(0.5).getX() == 1.5;
```

### Inheritance

```java
new Point(1,3)
$10 ==> Point@5c29bfd
```

- Why is the address value return when you creat a new point?
  - Point is inherited from default Object
  - toString method of default Object gives the address value
- To override use the `@Override` annotation

  - lets compiler knows that method is used to override parent class

- Mental model

_Random quote_
"While CS2040 trains you to be efficient, CS2030 trains you to be human."

### Bottom-up testing

- Test bottom first as bottom has no dependencies
- Go upwards once bottom passes
- i.e.
  - Start with Point first then Circle

### Cyclic dependency

- Unit Circle -> Circle -> Point -> Unit Circle
- Avoid cyclic dependencies
  - e.g. testing class A requires class B to be tested first, & vice versa
- Problem 
  - Book <-> Student
- Solution: Use an association class to break the cyclic dependency
  - Book <- Loan -> Student



* inheritance
  - every object inherits from from the object class
  - to override
    - have to override the method
* @Override notation
  - Tells compiler that is overriding the base object

```java
// Returns overrides class to String method
@Override
public String toString() {
  return 'x';
}
```

```java
public class Circle {
  private final Point centre;
  private final double radius;


  public Circle(Point centre, double radius) {
    this.radius = radius;
    this.centre = centre;
  }

  static Circle createCircle(Point point, double point) {
    if (radius > 0) {
      return new Point(point, radius);
    } else {
      return null;
    }
  }

  public boolean contains(Point point) {
    return centre.distanceTo(point) < radius + 1E-15;
  }

  @Override
  public String toString() {
    return "Circle centered at " + this.centre + " with radius " + radius;
  }
}
```

- Object oriented mental model

  - Establish mental model that is correct, consistent & complete

- factory methods
  - Check your constraints
