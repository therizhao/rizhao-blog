## Lesson 01

- Project
  - 1: Perfect cube project
    - Deadline: next week
    - Expect Multi iterations
    - 98 mm cube
    - 0.5mm precision
    - Tolerance: 97.5 - 98.5mm
    - Six-sided cube
    - Edges should not be potruding
    - Cleanliness
    - Use toothpick to apply the glue
    - Look after the cupboard to prevent it from curving
    - Board should not concave
    - Use the 1.3mm-thick board
    - Use a white board
      - Cos this guy wants to see if got stains
    - Triangle ruler
      - Might be useful to get it upright when gluing
      - Or get something reliably 90 degrees
        - To prevent skewing
    - Pen knife
      - Guy recommends getting a 30 degree blade
      - Expect to do a few cuts rather than single slash
      - Do a light cut to mark out the lines
      - Should be a 45 degrees cut
      - Might want to do test cuts
      - Use sharp knife
    - Re-submission for those who don't make the grade
      - 128mm box (plus minus 0.5mm)
      - Will compound as number of resubmission increases
    - 1.3mm Art Card
  - 2: Form study
  - 3: Mechanical toy
    - that produces sound
    - to create an orchestra

## Lesson 02

### Convexity

- Visual relationship btw elements
  - Putting diff parts tgt
  - Composing diff parts
  - Key concepts
    - **scale**
      - relative size
      - visual scale
      - hierarchy in terms of scale
        - dominant / subdominant / subordinate
          - dom
            - larger scale
          - subdom
            - medium scale
          - subordinate
            - smallest
            - complements overall composition
    - **proportion**
      - relative dimension
        - length / breadth / height
        - e.g.s of changing proportion
          - stretching a sphere
          - elongating cube
    - **axis**
      - imaginary line of rotation
      - gives sense of direction
      - if same axis:
        - more static
      - else:
        - more dynamic
      - e.g.
        - center line of a cylinder
      - axis can be curved too
      - for ellipse
        - major axis
          - longer diameter of ellipse
        - minor axis
          - shorter diameter of ellipse
    - **symmetry / asymmetry**
      - ex focuses on asymmetrical composition
      - radial symmetry
        - can rotate diff way
      - axiosymmetry
        - can cut along a particular axis
    - **surface tension**
      - if btw 2 forms
        - if tight st (x)
          - see 2 distinct shapes
        - else (y)
          - see 1 unified body
          - yet still able to see 2 bodies
      - goal of ex is to find in btw of x & y
        - use skin to combine 2 bodies to form unified body
        - working with organic forms
        - use basic shapes
        - nuanced harmony


### Project

- Make a model from clay
