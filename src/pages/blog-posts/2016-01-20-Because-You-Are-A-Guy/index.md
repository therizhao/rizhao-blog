"陈小明同学写的字很漂亮"
"像女孩子写的一样"

I blushed.

I walked up to collect my Chinese comprehension worksheet. The lady teacher gave me an affirmative smile.

I took the flimsy piece of paper and gripped it tightly.

Why in the world does she have to say that? What does she mean when she say that my handwriting is like a girl's? Is my handwriting really like a girl's?

I walked back to my seat.

I can hear the other students laughing, commenting.
Oh that teacher's pet, that try-hard, that girly boy.

I hate the teacher! I hate those stupid assh*les around me! I hate this tuition! I should never have come!

I will write like a guy next time. I will write large wriggly Chinese characters.

I will never want to be called doing anything like a girl again!

...

Flash forward 7 years, I am sitting in a boring econs lesson.

"Don't you all need to note it down? Your eyes like camera can take photo of everything is it? "

I took out my little notepad from my pocket, noting down the latest econs homework.

"Oh that notepad is really cute. Do you always put it in your pocket?"

"Yes I do."

What a weird teacher. But as a matter of fact, I do like my little notepad.

"Oh. Cos it's quite weird to see a guy do that. "

I am a girl damn it!

What's wrong with a guy using a notepad and putting it in his pocket? Why do people always have to use gender as a reason?

I remembered the countless times people told me you have to be responsible because you are a guy, you have to be sensitive to girls because you are a guy, you have to run more rounds because you are a guy...

I want to do what I want to do because I want to do it! Not because I am a guy, not because I got an extra pair of balls!

But Science!

Science says that guys are fitter, that girls are weaker, that guys are more careless and girls are more meticulous.

Yes!

Science also said that the Negroes are distant relatives of chimpanzees, that Jews are specialised for parasitical existence of other countries, that Asians are yellow, greedy and easily distracted.

Our perceptions are shaped by our stereotypes. Our differences are created by our stereotypes.

Who are the people who came up with these theories? How many times have they been proven wrong and wrong again?

Are girls and guys different because of our genes or is it because of our society, our family and our education constantly reminding us to stay in our gender stereotypes?

Do we want to limit ourselves just to fit into our gender roles?

...

In October 2015, RV announced that all Year 5 Boys have to go for ALL BOYS CAMP to toughen themselves up and all Year 5 Girls have to go for GROOMING AND ETIQUETTE SESSION to learn how to be nice and gracious ladies.

...

"I would have argued against the teacher if I am a guy. But I am a girl. " She said.

...

" You are a guy! You shouldn't be so sensitive to things girls say." The PW teacher said.
