I remember. 10 months ago. I decided I wanted to do something.

**I decided I should put my dreams into action.**

I never thought I will do it now.

I thought I will do it someday.

Someday when I have some money, some connections, some experience.

**I knew nothing.** I was stupid. I had no idea how to run a business. I had no idea how to start anything. I had never started anything. I had never read any books about how to start anything.

**I thought I was smart.** I thought I was on top of the world. I thought anything was possible.

I was self-delusional. There's no way I'm gonna succeed.

**I was a little afraid.** I had never done anything like that. I might get screwed. I might never make it happen. People would laugh at me.

I remembered how my teachers said that I was irresponsible. I remembered my past failures. I remembered how I always gave up. I should be afraid.

But a part of me said.

"This year is different."

"This year I will make it happen."

**I stepped over the border.** I threw myself in.

I built a gaming shed. *I was forced to destroy it 2 days later.*

I bought 100 power banks. *Haven't sold finish them yet.*

I started the food critique club. *It didn't last for 3 months.*

I started rvmamashop. *I was forced to close it after 3 months.*

I began notamaze. *I gave up.*

I started another business. I thought that this time I will succeed. Failed as bad as the others.

*I am still as stupid as ever.*

We always think that we are smart. *But we don't know what we don't know.*

But through pain. I have grown a little smarter. A little more experienced. Understand myself a little bit better.

*I will continue doing beautiful things.* **Because I love it.**
