NS is not necessary if we are as humans a little more developed; if we can learn to love a little more than we hate; if we can speak a little more than we fight; if we are a little less insecure; if we can forget about our ridiculous fetishes of our muscles; if we can have a little more compassion for our fellow humankind regardless of borders and beliefs.

Unfortunately, we can't.

We are forever stuck in the imaginary 'us vs them' mentality; entrenched in hatred for our so-called enemy.

We zealously arm ourselves in the name of defence; in the name of world peace.

Big tanks, fancy navy, fighter planes, young men. We love to showboat our pathetic muscles for the sake of threat and dominance.

No! I don't want to serve!

But who wants to?

As individuals, we are nothing more than worthless chess pieces in the game of hatred and death.

But we are absolutely important.

For without a strength in numbers, how else could we defend?

Only with NS can thousands of young men give up themselves for the sake of our so-called country. Only with NS can we lose our personal identity to fight against our so-called enemy. Only with NS can we listen to orders, submit to power and do what it's told. Only with NS can we have a competent 'defence' force to shoot down the enemy planes, the enemy men, and their families and friends. Only with NS can we pathetically protect ourselves.

So give me the arms, give me the grenades, give me the bayonets. In exchange I will give you my soul, I will give you my futile strength to defend our beautiful country.

Come fellow men! Let's wait for the day our firepower becomes more than we can hold, our hatred becomes more than we can stomach; let's wait for the day someone presses the trigger; let's wait for the day we destroy ourselves because of our petty nationalism.

Training to be soldiers; fight for our land; once in our lives; two years of our time

Have you ever wondered?

Why must we serve?

Because we love our land.

And we want to be free, to be free, to be free...

...

Or are we really free?

...

Unfortunately, NS is necessary.
