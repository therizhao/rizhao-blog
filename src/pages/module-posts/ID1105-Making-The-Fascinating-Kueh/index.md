- Limitations:
  - Steaming as main fabrication of method
  - Any type of flour as key ingredient
  - Additional proccesses are allowed
  - Edible additives are allowed
- Project length:
  - 6 weeks (17 Aug 2019 - 17 Sep 2019)
- Deliverables:
  - Fascinating piece of cooked flour
  - Document fabrication process
  - High resolution, well taken photos of final work and making process
  - Documentation of Explorations (Is done on this page)
  - Reflection Piece

## Plan

According to the professor, I should not have a plan. This project is an exploration process. I will however still have a rough plan to prevent things from going out of hand.

### My Rough Plan 😛

15. At 5 min, I stucked a chopstick into the kueh to try out how it taste
    -  The texture is very grainy 😬

    -  At least, it tastes sweet 🍬

### Reflection time ⏱

- Things didn't turn out as bad as I expected it to be
- Location may affect the Kueh made
  - E.g. Prototyping Lab vs RC vs My Home vs My Friend's Home
- Unplanned-for ingredients might be the dealbreakers sometimes
