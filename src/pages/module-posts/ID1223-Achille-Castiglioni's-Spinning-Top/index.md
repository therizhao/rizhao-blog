## Introduction

In this assignment, we have to design and fabricate a spinning top belonging to a designer we have been assigned to. My designer is [this Italian guy who has passed away](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achille_Castiglioni).

### Task Requirement:

- Demonstrate how your spinning top belongs in the designer's body of work
- Pitch Day
  - 3-slide A4 Summary Presentation
  - Deadline: 9 Sept 2019
- Exhibition Day
  - Appearance Model and print-outs of 3-page summary slides
  - Peer Evaluation Session
  - Date: 17 Sept 2019
- Appearance Model
  - Scale: 1:1
  - Encouraged to use materials and processes indicative of the designer and era
  - May purchase existing spinning top from market

```
Name: Achille Castiglioni

Country: Italy üáÆüáπ

Born: 16 February 1918

Died: 2 December 2002 (aged 84)

Studio: Castiglioni Studio (Was actually co-founded by Pier & Livio Giacomo)
```

## Abbrevations:

- **I:** Idea
- **A:** Assignment

## The Spinning Top

### Diagnosis

- Mr Castiglioni is very focused on making things functional üî®

"...I cannot but wish that education and culture will lead users to reject prestige pieces, and the industry to manufacture increasingly genuine and less expensive objects, without using designers' names to raise the prices. Let designers names disappear but their works be used, if valuable to create products of real industrial design-nones that can be labelled neither Italian nor Euopean. So: not Italian success, but the success of a valuable design method."[^1]

"There is no Castiglioni style. There is a Castiglioni method. What matters is only the function of objects, their use."[^2]

- I heaved a sigh of relief when I read the above quotes. I personally despise overpriced "useless" items wasting our Earth's precious resources.
- It is such an irony though that his lamp is now being sold for [impossibly high prices](https://www.finnishdesignshop.com/lighting-floor-lamps-arco-floor-lamp-p-17805.html?region=sg&gclid=Cj0KCQjwy97qBRDoARIsAITONTI-QSJyglpxeYlg2pqP0MG9mxbyg6BG1jO19fCJl692m6F3VuniXyQaAvA0EALw_wcB).

### My Spinning Top Ideas

#### I01 Colander with Spinnning Top Base

**Why Colander?**

- The colander is a pretty well-established design archetype
  - It is easier to make something useful when you already have something useful to build upon
- The colander does have a flaw:
  - It take ages sometimes to strain out all the water ‚è≥

**How would it work?**

- The spinning top colander will work like a tumbler dryer üí¶
- Spinning the colander will dry the items inside quicker ‚ö°Ô∏è

**Why Spinning Top Colander?**

- Drying stuff in a colander is pretty boring
- There is nothing much one can do to accelerate the process, making it very frustrating üò£
- It would be fun to have something to play with while saving time in the process

#### I02 Colander With Spinning Top Base & Shields

![Colander with Spinnning Top Base & Shields sketch](5.jpg)

**Shields?**

- While I was happily sharing my idea with my friend, he pointed out that the water will spray out when one spins the colander
- The most obvious solution is to add shields at the sides
- Thankfully, the items will stick to the upper half of the colander when one spins it (like a tumbler dryer)
- Hence, the shields will only be needed on the upper half of the colander

**Might they actually be needed?**

- Adding shields will increase the cost of making the colander
- As a frugal person, I am not really enthusiastic about the idea of spending too much money on a project that has low probability of generating profits
- The user may choose to spin the *colander without a shield* in the sink instead
- In that case, the water won't be sprayed onto his/her clothing üëö

**Thoughts ü§î**

- It is impossible for me to know whether the colander idea works until I try it out
- Over the next few weeks, I will try to get a colander and solder a spinning top at the bottom of it
- Then, I will try drying my breakfast [instant noodles](https://kokanoodles.com/product/koka-purple-wheat-chilli-lime-noodles/) with it
